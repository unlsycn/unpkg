  <longdescription lang="en">fre is a CLI tool for tracking your most-used directories and files.
    Though inspired by tools like autojump or the z plugin for zsh, it takes a slightly different
    approach to tracking and providing usage data. The primary difference is fre does not support
    jumping. Instead, it just keeps track of and provides sorting methods for directories, which can
    then be filtered by another application like fzf, which does a much better job of filtering than
    something I can write. Additionally, it uses an algorithm in which the weights of each directory
    decay exponentially, so more recently used directories are ranked more highly in a smooth
    manner.
